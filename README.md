# HarryPotterExercisesInSwift
These are exercise of basicprogramming language in Swift from Dev Mountain Pre-Course iOS development. It include 3 projects. 

## What I learn

### Wizarding World Profile
* In this project, I built out a profile for my favorite Wizarding World character. I created variables or constants (whichever is most appropriate) of their personal details.

### Diagon Alley Shopping Trip
* In this project, I writed about first trip to Diagon alley for school supplies. I created variables or constants, whichever is more appropriate, of each data. I used what I've learned about the various operators to keep track of how much gold, or galleons. I also used control flow to help decide which house is best for each student and what pet to take on day one.

### Quidditch Match
* For this project, I used functions and loops to handle the ultimate quidditch match, The Holyhead Harpies vs The Montrose Magpies!
